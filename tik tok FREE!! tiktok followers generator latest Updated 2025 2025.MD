<br>I hit 10,000 TikTok followers today. Normally, I don‚Äôt make a big deal out of this stuff. But, this feels like quite an accomplishment given the dramatic shift I‚Äôve made.

<br>It would be safe to say that six months ago, this would have been laughable. I wasn‚Äôt active on TikTok, and I detested everything about it (and short-form video generally). But, by the end of October, I put my old man shoes away and realized that this was something I needed to do.
<br>When I committed to it, I made a conscious decision to become the most followed account related to the topic of Facebook ads on TikTok. I‚Äôm obviously not there yet, but this is a nice milestone.

<br>What I did was simple and complicated at the same time. It really comes down to two things‚Ä¶

<br>The toughest part of getting started is publishing videos into the void. Maybe it was to give me a psychological boost or to make my profile look a bit more desirable in the early going, but I ran a low level of TikTok ads during the first couple of months.
<br>From the time I committed to creating videos on TikTok in October through the middle of December, I collected 3,253 followers via ads. It was a nice foundation.
<br>This was good and bad.

<br>The bad: I tried really hard to target precisely to build my audience with relevant people. All indications are that this wasn‚Äôt successful. It was mostly numbers padding (the relevant followers would come organically).
<br>The good: We can knock vanity metrics all we want, but it does mean something on TikTok if someone has a following. It surely helped convince some relevant people that I was worth following.

<br>Did this lead to a significant spike in engagement during those first few months? Not really. But I do think that it helped me reach the next step.

<br>A Dedicated Commitment to Create
<br>Look, I could run ads forever on TikTok, but unless I was actually creating good content, it would not matter. I dedicated myself early.
<br>I would create bad videos in the beginning, there was no avoiding that. But the goal was to get myself out of that phase as quickly as possible. I created 70 videos in October. It was a difficult, challenging, and inefficient month of video creation.
<br>But it was worth it. I started to figure out my process. I found a workflow. Needs like software and lighting became clearer to me.
<br>I dedicated myself to publishing at least one video per day in 2025. Truthfully, I missed very few days once I started in October, but I wanted to avoid any days off going forward.

<br>I‚Äôve kept to that commitment and I‚Äôve published more than 260 videos on TikTok. Consistency, volume, and quality. More than anything else, I‚Äôd say that these were the keys to my growth.

<br>What I Didn‚Äôt Do
<br>I didn‚Äôt try to go viral. I didn‚Äôt worry about trends or popular sounds. Trust me, you‚Äôre going to hear a lot of advice around that stuff.
<br>But it‚Äôs wrong.
<br>If all you care about is being popular, sure. Chase that stuff. But you‚Äôre going to attract a very general, random audience. And that‚Äôs not how you build an engaged following around a specialty.
<br>While I haven‚Äôt completely niched down on TikTok (I talk about Facebook ads, video creation, and entrepreneurship), it‚Äôs at least a similar category. I don‚Äôt want to attract randos who don‚Äôt care about any of these things.
<br>The result: Engagement is growing with the audience size.
<br>Tracking Growth

<br>TikTok only offers analytics back 60 days, as far as I can tell. But even within the past two months, the improvement really jumps out.
<br>Those spikes are when some videos took off. I have three recent videos that received more than 30,000 views (all organic).
<br>Those three videos alone resulted in 2,942 new followers.
<br>But it‚Äôs not just those three. Here‚Äôs a look at the trend of views during the past 60 days‚Ä¶
<br>Even during the end of January, most days I‚Äôd receive very few views. But then something started to change. The floor raised.
<br>Engagement is no longer focused on a few videos. I can now expect that my recent videos will almost always get at least 1,000 views. That was definitely not the case before.
<br>That doesn‚Äôt mean that this new engagement level will continue forever, but it‚Äôs certainly a good sign.!
